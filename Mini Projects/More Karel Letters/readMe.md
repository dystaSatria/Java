# Overview
The provided Java method moreKarelLetters is designed to process a given string and modify it by duplicating certain characters. The specific characters that are duplicated are 'k', 'a', 'r', 'e', and 'l'. This method is useful in scenarios where you need to emphasize or highlight these characters in a string for various purposes, such as in educational tools, text processing applications, or specific domain requirements where these letters hold significance.

## Method Description

```java

public String moreKarelLetters(String str)

```

## Parameters:
* str (String): The input string to be processed.
Returns:
## String: The modified string after duplicating the specified characters.
## Functionality:
Initialization: A StringBuilder object, modifiedString, is created. This object is efficient for string modifications as it is mutable, unlike regular Java strings. A string lettersToDuplicate contains the characters to be duplicated ('k', 'a', 'r', 'e', 'l').

## Processing Each Character:

The method iterates through each character of the input string.
For each character, it checks if the character is one of the specified characters ('k', 'a', 'r', 'e', 'l').
If the character is found in lettersToDuplicate, it is appended twice to modifiedString; otherwise, it is appended once.
Result:

The method returns the String representation of modifiedString, which is the input string modified with the specified characters duplicated.
Example:

```java

String result = moreKarelLetters("keyboard");
System.out.println(result); // Output: kkeeyboarrd

```

In this example, the characters 'k', 'e', 'a', 'r' in the word "keyboard" are duplicated.

## Usage
This method can be used in various applications, including:

Educational Tools: For teaching purposes, especially in courses or lessons related to the characters 'k', 'a', 'r', 'e', 'l'.
Text Processing: In any application where these specific characters need emphasis or special processing.
Custom Filters: In systems that filter or alter text based on specific rules involving these characters.

## Conclusion
The moreKarelLetters method is a simple yet effective tool for duplicating specific characters in a string. Its implementation using StringBuilder ensures efficiency, especially for longer strings or applications where performance is a concern. This method can be easily integrated and customized for various applications that require specific text manipulation based on the characters 'k', 'a', 'r', 'e', and 'l'.
